			Codes

Let A be a set of character strings. Then A+ denotes the set of all possible 
character strings that can be obtained by concatenating one or more strings
in A. In other words, a string w is in A+ iff w = w_1. w_2. ... w_k for some
k >= 1 and w_i in A for 1 <= i <= k. (Here . denotes concatenation.)

The set A is called a code if every string w in A+ can be written in a unique 
way as w = w_1.w_2. .... w_k.

In this problem, given a set of strings, you have to determine whether it is a
code or not. If it is not a code, there exists a string w that can be obtained
by concatenating strings in A, in more than one way. You have to find the
shortest possible such string. If there is more than one of the same length,
find the lexicographically smallest string.

Input
The first line will contain n, the number of strings in the set A.
The next n lines will contain the strings, one per line.
You can assume the possible characters in the strings are small letters 
'a' to 'z' only.

Output
Output CODE if the given set is a code, otherwise output the shortest and
lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained in more than one way.


Hint
If no string in A is a prefix of any other string in A, then A must be
a code. (Why?) Define an operator - on strings where w1 - w2 = w3 iff
w1 = w2.w3, that is w2 is a prefix of w1 and w3 is obtained by deleting
this prefix of w1. Use this operator to design an algorithm.
Use good data structures for implementing the algorithm. A simple 
implementation, that may take O(n^2) time, will work for at most half the
cases.

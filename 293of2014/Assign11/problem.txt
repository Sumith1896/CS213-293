		Problem G ICPC World Finals 2014.

The formal statement of the problem is as follows. The input consists of
a graph with n nodes and specified distances d(i,j) between nodes i and j,
for all 1 <= i,j <= n. For a subset A of nodes, the disparity of the subset
A is the maximum distance between two nodes in the subset A. The problem
is to find a partition of the nodes into 2 parts A and B such that
disparity(A) + disparity(B) is minimized.

Input
The input consists of a single test case. The first line contains an integer n 
(1 <=  n <= 200) indicating the number of nodes. The following n-1 lines 
contain the distances d(i,j). The ith of these lines contains n-i integers and 
the jth integer of that line gives the value of d(i,i + j). The distances are
symmetric, so d(j,i) = d(i,j), and also d(i,i) = 0 for all i. All distances are 
integers between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive).

Output

Display the minimum possible sum of disparities for partitioning the nodes.

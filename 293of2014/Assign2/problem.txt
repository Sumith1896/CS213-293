			Matrix class

In this assignment, you have to write a matrix class and implement some
operations on matrices. Note that your file must contain only the
definition of the class and its methods, and no main program that uses 
the class. (You can write one to test your class but remove it
before submisison.)

The values to  be represented are n x m matrices with integer entries,
where n, m can be arbitrary numbers.

The operations to be performed on the matrix are:

0. Constructors that create a null matrix, a n x m matrix with 0 entries,
   a copy constructor, a destructor.

1. operators * and +, return the sum and product of two matrices.
   You can assume their sizes are properly defined.

2. operator ~ that returns the transpose of the matrix.

3. The = operator that assigns one matrix to another.

4. M(i,j) - the function call operator that returns a reference to the
            ij th entry of the matrix.

5. M(i,j,k,l) - returns the submatrix containing k consecutive rows and 
                l columns, starting from the i,j th entry.

6. M(i,j,A)- returns the matrix obtained by replacing the submatrix of
             M, consisting of consecutive rows and columns, starting with 
             the i,j th entry by the matrix A.
	     You can assume that the size of M is large enough so that
             matrix A fits in.

SAMPLE USE

Matrix A(10,10),B(10,20),C(20,10);

A(3,5) = 10 + B(5,2);

A = A + (~(B * C));

A = A(5,5,B(3,4,2,3));





SUBMISSION

PLEASE UPLOAD A SINGLE FILE NAMED ROLLNO_2.cpp.
Do not use tar or zip the files.
Ensure that the syntax of the operators is correct.
The name of the class must be Matrix.

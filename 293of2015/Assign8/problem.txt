If you solve the problem as given, you will get about half the marks.

As an extension, for each input, print the answer if the number of lanes was i, for all 1 <= i <= n, rather than considering all n lanes. There will be n answers for each input, considering only the ships in the first i lanes, for 1 <= i <= n. There is no change in input format or time limit. The time limit is 3 sec but it takes less than 0.5 seconds for the test data.

Print the answer up to 8 decimal digits.

The test cases from the ICPC are available at www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~aad/cs293/Assign8



Note: Simple algorithm for the basic problem. For every ship, there is a forbidden time interval during which the ferry cannot start. Find this for each ship. The union of all of these is forbidden as a starting time for the ferry. The largest gap between the intervals in the union, that lies between t1 and t2 is the answer.

To find these, simply sort all intervals by their starting points and do one left to right pass on the vector of sorted intervals.
